# QA2
<<<<<<< HEAD
This is my quarterly assessmnet #2 for my DS 3850 class. In this project I am essentially merging a scratch-created database into a funtional quiz for users. 

The first file is my 'QA2_Create.py" file where I demonstrate how to create a new SQL database and insert tables. The 5 tables in this project are the 5 classes I am currently taking with each table having a primary key of the 'class name_question' and another column titled 'answer'.

The next 2 files titled "QA2_Insert.py" and "QA2_Insert2.py" are the files I used to insert questions and answers into the tables. 

"QA2_Data_Extract.py" is a "Read" file I used to pull all the table names and values and print them for user to visualize. 

Next I created the main part of this project in the "QA2_App.py" file. This is the file that takes the tables and their values and configures into 5 different that the users can choose and complete. Some added features include a scrambling of questions each time the user re-takes the quiz and feedback that gives the correct answer when an incorrect answer is given. 

Finally, I created another inser file titled "QA2_Insert_More.py" this is a more refined version of the last two as I ustilized several commits to insert the remaining values more efficiently as opposed to adding all the values into all the tables at once
